#### Valid Mathematical Operators

| Operator | Mathematical Expression  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | equal to                 |
| !=       | not equal to             |

| <        | less than                |
| \|\|     | logical OR               |
| &&       | logical conjunction      |

## Example(s)

This will return `false` as `50` is greater than `25`:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'checkCondition',
    code: `
  $checkCondition[50>25]
  `
});
```

### Advanced Example

#### Logical conjunction

This will return `true` as `50` is greater than `25` and `120` is less than `280`:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'checkCondition',
    code: `
  $checkCondition[50>25&&120<280]
  `
});
```

#### Logical OR

This will return `true` as one of the two arguments (`50>25`) are `true`:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: 'checkCondition',
    code: `
  $checkCondition[50>25||true==false]
  `
});
```
