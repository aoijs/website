#### Valid Mathematical Operators

| Operator | Mathematical Expression  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | equal to                 |
| !=       | not equal to             |
| <=       | less than or equal to    |
| \>=      | greater than or equal to |
| \>       | greater than             |
| <        | less than                |
| \|\|     | logical OR               |
| &&       | logical AND              |

## Example(s)

This will return `That's false!` as `1` doesn't equal `2`:

```javascript
client.command({
  name: "if",
  code: `
    $if[1==2;That's true!;That's false!]
    `
});
```

This will do the exact same just different usage of `$if` by using `$if: "old"`:

```javascript
client.command({
  name: "if",
  $if: "old",
  code: `
    $if[1==2]
    That's true!
    $else
    That's false!
    $endif
    `
});
```
