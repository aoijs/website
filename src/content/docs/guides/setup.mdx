## Setup

import { Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard, Steps, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

To get started with aoi.js, you will need to install the package. You can do so by running the following command in your terminal.

<Steps>

1. #### Installing `aoi.js`
   - using the package manager of your choice, run the following command to install aoi.js.

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">

        ```bash
        npm install aoi.js
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">

        ```bash
        pnpm add aoi.js
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">

        ```bash
        yarn add aoi.js
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">

        ```bash
        bun install aoi.js
        ```

        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <br />

2. #### Creating the Discord Bot

    After doing so you will need to create an application from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and get the bot token from there.

    - Make sure all the intents are enabled, as some functions require them. If you can't do so then ignore this step.
    - Copy the Discord Bot Token for later.

    <br /> 

3. #### Setting up the bot

        ##### Create your main file

            Before we get started, create a new file called `index.js` within your project folder. This will be the main file for your bot.

            <FileTree>
            - **index.js**
            - package.json
            - node_modules
              - ...
            - ...
            </FileTree>

        <br />

        ##### Create the base of your bot

            To get the bot running we need to create a new instance of the `AoiClient` class. This class is the main class for the bot and is used to interact with the Discord API.

            Basically this will be the content of your **index.js** file.

            ```js title="index.js"
            const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");

            const client = new AoiClient({
                token: "Discord Bot Token",
                prefix: "Discord Bot Prefix",
                intents: ["MessageContent", "Guilds", "GuildMessages"],
                events: ["onMessage", "onInteractionCreate"],
                database: {
                    type: "aoi.db",
                    db: require("@akarui/aoi.db"),
                    dbType: "KeyValue",
                    tables: ["main"],
                    securityKey: "a-32-characters-long-string-here"
                }
            });
            ```

            The token part is where your Discord Bot Token goes, which you previously copied from the Developer Portal.
            ```diff lang="js" title="index.js"
            +token: "Your Discord Bot Token"
            ```

            The prefix part is where your bot's prefix goes, you can even have multiple prefixes.

            ```js "one prefix" "multiple prefixes"
            // To have one prefix
            prefix: "Your Discord Bot Prefix"

            // You can also have multiple prefixes
            prefix: ["Your Prefix", "Another Prefix"]
            ```

    Now we can run our bot, but there isn't any functionality yet.
