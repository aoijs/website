## Sub commands

Sub-commands are apart of slash commands and are used to add as the name already suggest sub commands to the regular slash command. Which does not only "bypass" the slash command limit but also allows you to properly structure your application commands.

## Creating Application Commands

```js
$createApplicationCommand[guildID/global;name;description;defaultPermission(true/false);type(slash/user/message);options?]
```

### Examples of creating Application Commands with sub commands

```js
client.command({
  name: "createApplicationCommand",
  code: `
  $createApplicationCommand[guildID/global;moderation;Moderation Commands!;true;true;slash;[
    {
      "name": "kick",
      "description": "Kick someone of your guild!",
      "type": 1 
    },
    {
      "name": "ban",
      "description": "Ban someone of your guild!",
      "type": 1 
    }
  ]]`
});
```

#### Creating Sub Commands with options

Creating sub commands with options or choices work basically the same as any other.

```js
client.command({
  name: "createApplicationCommand",
  code: `
  $createApplicationCommand[$guildID;moderation;Moderation Commands!;true;true;slash;[
  {
    "name": "kick",
    "description": "Kick someone out of your guild!",
    "type": 1,
    "options": [
      {
        "name": "user",
        "description": "Mention the user you want to kick",
        "required": true,
        "type": 6
      },
      {
        "name": "reason",
        "description": "Reason",
        "required": true,
        "type": 3
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "ban",
    "description": "Ban someone of your guild!",
    "type": 1,
    "options": [
        {
          "name": "user",
          "description": "Mention the user you want to kick",
          "required": true,
          "type": 6
        },
        {
          "name": "reason",
          "description": "Reason",
          "required": true,
          "type": 3
        }
      ]
  }]
]`
});
```

That would for example add two options called "user" and "reason", where reason is type 3, string and user type 6, mention (user).

## Replying to Sub commands

```js
<client>.interactionCommand({
    name: "moderation",
    sub_command: "ban"
    prototype: "slash"
    code: ...
})
```

This would only make the bot reply to the "ban" sub-command, you can return the sub-command with `$interactionData[options._subcommand]`.
