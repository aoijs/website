Before we get started let's cover the basics.

- aoi.js reads **bottom** to **top**, meaning the code starts from the bottom and starts working towards the top.

An example for that is the following:

```js
client.command({
  name: "example",
  code: `
  $sendMessage[Bye!]
  $sendMessage[Hello!]
  `
});
```

In this case, the code will send `Hello!` first and then `Bye!`. This applies to all commands within aoi.js.

## Creating Commands

Creating commands brings functionality to your bot, this structure will be used for all commands including events. Events will be covered at a later time.

The structure is as following, (if you're not using a command handler):

```js
<client>.command({ ... });
```

`<client>` stands for the AoiClient you defined in your `index.js` file at the very top.

Commands have a variety of properties, which will be covered in the next section.

For now you only need to know about `name` and `code`.

---

The `name` defines the name of the command and also how to execute it. Meaning you would be able to use `[prefix]name` to execute the command.

```js
<client>.command({ 
  name: "ping" 
});
```

This does nothing, as of now. It's just a command called `ping`. To give it functionality we use the `code` property.

The code property defines the **functionality** of the command - its core.

```js
<client>.command({ 
  name: "ping",
  code: `My ping is: $ping MS!`
});
```

This would execute upon using the `[prefix]ping` within your Discord Server, this would return the current bot latency.

### Command Options

There are a variety of commands, event commands, base commands, interaction commands and way more.

#### Base Commands

The base command, also known as prefix command has a few properties.

```js
<client>.command({ 
    name: string,
    aliases? : string,
    nonPrefixed? : boolean,
    executeAt? : string,
    code: string
});
```

An example of using all properties would be the following:

```js
<client>.command({ 
    name: "ping",
    aliases: ["pong"],
    nonPrefixed: false,
    executeAt: "both",
    code: `My ping is $ping MS!`
});
```

| OPTION        | INPUT   | EXPLANATION                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string  | Command Name.                                                                                                          |
| `aliases`     | string  | Aliases, work the same way as `name`.                                                                                  |
| `nonPrefixed` | boolean | Set your command as non prefixed, meaning it can be executed without the actual prefix.                                |
| `dmOnly`      | boolean | Set the command to be useably only in guilds or Direct Messages.                                                       |
| `executeAt`   | string  | Define where it may can get executed in. <br /> 1. **guild** <br /> 2. **dm** <br /> 3. **groupDM** <br /> 4. **both** |
| `code`        | string  | Your command code.                                                                                                     |

#### Event Commands

Event commands have the following structure:

```js
<client>.<event>Command({
    name? : string,
    channel? : string,
    code: string,
})
```

`<client>` stands - once again - for the AoiClient you defined in your `index.js` file at the very top.

`<event>` stands for the event you want to use for example `onBanAdd` would become `<client>.banAddCommand()`. this applies to all commands.

An example of using all properties would be the following:

```js
<client>.banAddCommand({ 
    name: "Event Command Example",
    channel: "123456789012345", // **must** be a valid channel ID
    code: `
    <@$authorID> just got banned!
    `
});
```

```js
<client>.interactionCommand({
    name: string,
    type: string,
    prototype: string,
    code: string,
});
```

### Command Handler

You can also keep your `index.js` - or whatever the file is called for you - neat and tidy, by using command handlers.

By using command handlers, you're creating a file for each command instead of putting them all in the same file.

```diff lang="js"
const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");

const client = new AoiClient({
  // our configuration
});

+ client.loadCommands("./commands/", true); // This will be your commands folder, you can give it any name you want. The true enables the logging, you can disable it by replacing true with false.
```

Make sure to create a commands folder in the root directory, meaning where your index.js file is located.

<FileTree>

- index.js your **main file**
- package.json
- commands the folder for your **commands**
- ...

</FileTree>

---

Once that is done, we start creating files inside of that folder.

<FileTree>

- index.js
- package.json
- commands the folder for your **commands**
  - ping.js
- ...

</FileTree>

These files can be named what you want, however you need to add the `.js` syntax after the name, to turn it into a Javascript file.

Let's, once again, create a ping command. It's basically the same, just one line changes.

```diff lang="js"
- <client>.command({
+ module.exports = ({
    name: "ping",
    code: `My ping is $ping MS!` // The ping function returns the current ping.
});
```

Everything besides the first line stays the same, easy right?

Your command should look like this in the end:

```js
module.exports = ({
    name: "ping",
    code: `My ping is $ping MS!` // The ping function returns the current ping.
});
```

---

So let's look at adding **multiple** commands to the same file, yes, multiple!

Yet again, we pretty much only change the first and last line.

```diff lang="js"
- module.exports = ({
+ module.exports = [{
    name: "ping",
    code: `My ping is $ping MS!` // The ping function returns the current ping.
- });
+ }, {
+   name: "uptime",
+   code: `I'm online for $uptime!` // The uptime function returns the current uptime in hours, minutes and seconds.
+ }];
```

This is basically an array just with a little extra spice.

Your command should look like this in the end,

```js
module.exports = [{
  name: "ping",
  code: `My ping is $ping MS!` // The ping function returns the current ping.
}, {
  name: "uptime",
  code: `I'm online for $uptime!` // The uptime function returns the current uptime in hours, minutes and seconds.
}];
```
