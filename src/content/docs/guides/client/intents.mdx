  - All intents marked with (**R**) require verification if your bot is in more
  than 100 guilds. 
  - For more information on each intent and its specific use
  cases, refer to the official Discord.js documentation:
  [https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents)

Two types of intents exist:

- Standard intents can be passed by default. You don't need any additional permissions or configurations.
- [Privileged intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents) require you to toggle the intent for your app in your app's settings within the Developer Portal before passing said intent. For verified apps (required for apps in 100+ guilds), the intent must also be approved after the verification process to use the intent.
