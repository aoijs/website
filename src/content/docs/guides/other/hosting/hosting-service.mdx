::::tip[What is a Host?]

A host is a service that allows you to run your bot 24/7 without needing to keep your computer on all the time. This is useful if you want your bot to be online all the time.

::::

:::note[Why not use replit? It's free!]

**Repl.it** was never intended to be a **hosting service**. It's a platform for coding and sharing code.

Repl.it offers little for the free tier, and it's not recommended to use it for hosting a bot. It's better to use a dedicated host for your bot.

You will get ratelimited a lot and after their recent update, you can't run a bot 24/7 anymore.

## Setting up

:::note[I can't access the console..?]

If you can't access the console, then see if you can change the startup command or if you see an additional packages tab to enter your packages manually.

You can also set, if applicable, the startup command to `bash` to use the console.

:::

<Steps>

1. Find a host to use.
   This will be probably the hardest step if you plan on not paying for one. One of the most trusted free hosts is [DBH](https://danbot.host/), but there are many others out there. If you're willing to pay, you can use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. Access your created server.

3. Use the console to install and set up your server.

    ```bash title="Installing packages"
    npm init -y && npm install aoi.js
    ```

4. Create a new project
    ```bash title="Creating Project"
    aoijs create --dir ./
    ```

</Steps>

After doing those steps, we're ready to get started!

## Editing Files

Once the project is created, you can edit the files in the `aoijs` directory using the host's built-in text editor.

You can access all your files via the `Files` tab in most cases.

Continue to navigate there, that's where you can edit the `index.js` file.

Add your Discord Bot token and your prefix to the file, then save it by pressing `Ctrl + S`, or using the save button.

Do the same for your commands as you did with your `index.js` file.
