:::note[What is Termux?]

Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.

:::

:::caution[Note]

Please note that your bot will only be online when your phone is on and connected to the internet. If you want your bot to be online 24/7, you should consider using a VPS or a hosting service.

Your Bot ping will be higher than usual, and it may not be as stable as a VPS or hosting service.

    pkg install nodejs-lts
    ```

3. Install CLI

</Steps>

After doing those steps, we're ready to get started!

## Running CLI

            id: "setting-up",
            label: "Setting up Termux",
            percentageComplete: 100,
            status: "visited",
            href: "#setting-up-termux"
        },
        {
            id: "running-cli",
            label: "Running CLI (you're here!)",
            percentageComplete: 25,
            status: "current",
            href: "#running-cli"
        },
        {
            id: "editing-files",
            label: "Editing Files",
            percentageComplete: 0,
            status: "unvisited",
            href: "#editing-files"
        },
        {
            id: "done",
            label: "Complete 🎉",
            percentageComplete: 0,
            status: "unvisited",
            href: "#setting-up-termux"
        }
    ]}
/>

To create our project easily and quickly, we will use the CLI. To do this, run the following command:

```bash title="Creating a project"
aoijs create --dir ./aoijs
```

This will create a new project in the `aoijs` directory and install all needed packages for us, wait for it to finish.

## Editing Files

Once the project is created, you can edit the files in the `aoijs` directory using your favorite text editor. You can use `nano`, `vim`, or `vi` to edit the files.

```bash title="Editing files"
cd aoijs
nano index.js
```

This will open the built-in text editor, `nano`, where you can edit the `index.js` file.

Add your Discord Bot token and your prefix to the file, then save it by pressing `Ctrl + O`, `ENTER` and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

Do the same for your commands as you did with your `index.js` file.
