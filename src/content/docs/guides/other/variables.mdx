This guide will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of variables.

### Using Variables

Variables are useful tools in programming that allow you to store values that can be accessed and manipulated throughout your code. To use a variable, you first need to declare it by giving it a name and assigning a value to it.

One way to do this is by using the following code snippet in your main file (usually named `index.js`):

```js
client.variables({
  variableName: boolean,
  variableName: number,
  variableName: object,
  variableName: "string",
}, table?);
```

The `client.variables()` function takes an object as an argument, where each property represents a variable name and its corresponding value. You can assign variables to a certain table. However, this is optional and will default to "main".

For example:

```js
client.variables({
    blacklisted: false,
    money: 0,
    developers: {},
    title: "none",
  }, "main");
```

This also works:

```js
client.variables({
  blacklisted: false,
  money: 0,
  developers: {},
  title: "none",
});
```

## Variable Handlers

Another way to use variables is by using a variable handler, which can help keep your main file organized and cleaner. To set up a variable handler, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Create the directory
    - Create a folder with the name `handler` in the main directory.

    <FileTree>
    - index.js your **main file**
    - package.json
    - commands your **commands folder**
      - ban.js
      - ...
    - handler your **handler folder**
    </FileTree>

2. Create the file
    - Create a file with the name `variables.js` in the `handler` folder.

    <FileTree>
    - index.js your **main file**
    - package.json
    - commands your **commands folder**
      - ban.js
      - ...
    - handler your **handler folder**
      - variables.js
    </FileTree>

3. Edit the index.js file
    - In the `index.js` file, require the `variables.js` file.
    
    ```js
    require("./handler/variables.js")(client);
    ```

4. Modify your `handler/variables.js`
    - In the `handler/variables.js` file, export a function that takes a client as an argument including your variables.

    ```js
    module.exports = (client) => {
      client.variables({
        variableName: boolean,
        variableName: number,
        variableName: object,
        variableName: "string",
      }, table?);
    };
    ```

    For example:

    ```js
    module.exports = (client) => {
      client.variables({
        blacklisted: false,
        money: 0,
        developers: {},
        title: "none",
      }, "main");
    };
    ```

    This also works:

    ```js
    module.exports = (client) => {
      client.variables({
        blacklisted: false,
        money: 0,
        developers: {},
        title: "none",
      });
    };
    ```

</Steps>

With these steps, you now have a working variable handler, which can help you keep your code organized and easier to manage.
